The Exchange Server setup operation completed successfully.

Exchange Setup has enabled Extended Protection on all the virtual directories on this machine. For more information visit: https://aka.ms/EnableEPviaSetup.

We recommend periodically running the Exchange Health Checker script, as well as after setup, to evaluate the organization for additional recommended configurations and security best
 practices. The Health Checker script can be downloaded from https://aka.ms/ExchangeSetupHC.

Setup has made changes to operating system settings that require a reboot to take effect. Please reboot this server prior to placing it into production.
